The works are programmed for construction from Friday 31st July 2020 to Tuesday 11th August 2020, between 7am and 7pm, daytime working hours. There are currently no works programmed at the weekend. The road will remain open. However, to ensure the safety of road workers and the travelling public during these works, a 10mph convoy traffic management system will be implemented. The convoy system will be removed out with working hours, however a 30mph speed limit will remain in place, as traffic will be travelling over a temporary road surface. Premises and local residents will be permitted access during the works, although there may be times when this is restricted due to the nature of the works and to ensure the safety of the workforce and members of the public, which is of paramount importance. Access through the works site for emergency services will be maintained at all times.<br><\/p>",
