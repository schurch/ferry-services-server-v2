The road will remain open. However, to ensure the safety of road workers and the travelling public during these works, a 10mph convoy traffic management system will be implemented. The convoy system will be removed out with working hours, however a 30mph speed limit will remain in place, as traffic will be travelling over a temporary road surface. Premises and local residents will be permitted access during the works, although there may be times when this is restricted due to the nature of the works and to ensure the safety of the workforce and members of the public, which is of paramount importance.

The convoy system will be removed out with working hours, however a 30mph speed limit will remain in place, as traffic will be travelling over a temporary road surface.
